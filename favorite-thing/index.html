    <h1>My favorite things:</h1>
    <p>

        <ul> One of my favorite things about school is the classes that I enjoy. I really enjoy science based ciriculums and art electives. I also plan on advanced bio next year while taking chemistry to pursue my curiosity.</ul>
        <ul> Another one of my favorite aspects ot school is my friends. Seeing my friends 5x a week and sometimes 6 is really fun and they are what make it so enjoyable. They are also like a helping hand because they help me in a lot of things outside of
            school and school related things like homework and confusing things. </ul>

        <ul> I also really like electives. I enjoy learning new htings to see if my intrests lie there. Hence, one of the reasons I am taking Web Design right now. I have been meaning to make a website for my upcoming nonprofit organization and I haven't gotten
            the time to learn how to use JavaScript or HTML, so I think this class will be ver beneficial to taking the steps to create that website. Overall, I like expiriemtning with new electives in the school and pursuing passions I already have through
            them as well.</ul>

        <ul> Lastly, one of my favorite things is sports. I have always been decently active growing up and so getting into different sports I want to try out always came easy to me. So, I have found a really big passion for running. So, i always look forward
            to cross country/trakc practice at the end of the day. </ul>
