                <ul class="pink-text-big3">Progression:</ul>
                <ul class="pink-text-big1">For the longest time I have been doubting my progression in running. I sometimes find myself breathing heavily after a 2-3 miles run in practice. Yes, considering that the distance is pretty short we have to run pretty fast, but it just
                    reminds me of the time before this entire school year in quarentine where i would barely break a sweat running 2-3 miles. So, for some reason I feel like I'm not getting much faster, and if anything I am getting slower. I do knwo that
                    this is probably not true, but the throught still comes in my mind occasionally. Luckily, I track basically all of my runs, so one day I was really curious and scrolled all the way down to the bottom of my runkeeper app to take a look.
                    What I found was below:</ul>

                <ul class="pink-text-big1">
                    Throughout the cross country season, i obviously had many competitions (meets) and so I had many times to PR (personal record). However, it is not the norm that you PR every meet, considering in cross country the trail/place you are running on varies
                    so certain trails can be more difficult than others, leading you to not do better than last time every meet. However, when the trails get harder for you, they get harder for your opponents too, so usually they will also get slower.</ul>
