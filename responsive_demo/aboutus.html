                <h5>
                    The Seattle based artist, Saina Bhatt, has been honing her skills in artistry for the past 13 years. Ever since she could hold a pencil, she uncovered her fascinating passion for drawing and painting leading to her years of art experience. Although originally
                    being focused on animals and wildlife, Saina has recently found a new passion for landscape painting and hopes to continue this path and she experiments with different styles. Saina switches back and forth between painting and drawing
                    and she finds that each technique brings a different kind of life to her art piece resulting in a different feel altogether. Saina's evolution into her skill of art work today allowed her to introduce realism into her pieces to take
                    her range of talent and skill further.

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Our Cause </h2>
            <p style="text-align:center">Sai Save is a nonprofit organization that puts their earning towards preventing losses to pancreatic cancer. Ever since Saina was 6, she has found a passion for donating money towards pancreatic cancer research. Saina's grandfather did pass
                away from pancreatic cancer and ever since Saina and made it a point that no other kid would have to go through what she did. For the last 8 years on her birthday, instead of simply accepting gifts, she requested donation money for charity.
                Sai Save is able to take that mission one step further to raise more money. Saina has been devoted to the cause ever since so that one day scientists and researchers can find more effective treatmentÂ and help underprivileged cancer patients
                in rural parts of India.</p>
